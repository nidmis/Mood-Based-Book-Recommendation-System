# Mood-Based-Book-Recommendation-System
The Mood-Based Book Recommendation System is a web application built using Flask and Jinja2 templates in Python. It provides personalized book recommendations based on the user's mood selection. The application uses a pre-defined set of mood categories such as "Happy," "Sad," "Motivated," etc., and recommends relevant books for each mood category.

1)Key Features:

--User-Friendly Interface: The web interface allows users to select their current mood from a list of options.

--Dynamic Recommendations: Upon selecting a mood, the system dynamically fetches and displays a list of books suited to that mood.

--Interactive Design: Each book recommendation is presented in a visually appealing card format, with book titles and authors displayed alongside book icons.

--Navigation: Users can easily navigate back to the mood selection page to explore recommendations for different moods.

2)Technologies Used:

--Flask: A micro web framework used to handle routing and request handling.

--Jinja2 Templates: Integrated with Flask to render HTML templates with dynamic content.
