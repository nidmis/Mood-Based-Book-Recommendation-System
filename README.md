# Mood-Based-Book-Recommendation-System
The Mood-Based Book Recommendation System is a web application built using Flask and Jinja2 templates in Python. It provides personalized book recommendations based on the user's mood selection. The application uses a pre-defined set of mood categories such as "Happy," "Sad," "Motivated," etc., and recommends relevant books for each mood category.
